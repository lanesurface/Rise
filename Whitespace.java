By dark we toll in the depths                                                   ,
and in day we dare not show ourselves                                           ,
for we are a legion of desparates                                               ,
and the world cast us aside                                                     .
Now is our time                                                                 ,

Bear the cross of the mighty one                                                ,
and be not afraid of condemnation                                               .
Those who mocked our ways have risen                                            ;
